We've added new material to address gaps in the manuscript identified
by the previous referee report. The referee's comments are quoted below.

  I do not understand why the authors do not quote the values for some
  basic quantities related to the model used. Quantities such as the
  proton-proton cross section, the p-p wounding profile or p-p elastic
  differential cross section have nothing to do with the application of
  the hydrodynamic evolution in the dynamics. These are basic elements
  of the model. If the authors take at face value quantities such as the
  constituent position radius, the number of constituents, the width of
  constituent, why they claim that it is premature to calculate the
  proton-proton cross section in the model.

  The p-p inelasticity (wounding) profile can be obtained simply by
  counting the number of p-p interactions at different impact
  parameters, its integral gives the p-p inelastic cross section. The
  reader should know if the model using subnuclear degrees of freedom
  fulfills basic consistency checks at the level of nucleon-nucleon
  interactions. For example one expects the n-n cross section to be
  around 40-70mb for RHIC-LHC energies, what is the value of this cross
  section in the model presented.

  Before the paper could be published the authors should include a
  calculation of

  1) the p-p inelasticity profile

  2) the p-p inelastic cross section (parameterization/interpolation of
  the experimental scattering amplitude can be used to compare to the
  data, see the paper quoted in my previous report) for the best
  parameters obtained at 5.02 TeV.

We agree with the assessment of the referee and acknowledge that the
previous version of the manuscript lacked a satisfactory discussion of
proton-proton observables. We have addressed this criticism by discussing
the aforementioned quantities in the revised version of the manuscript.
Our responses to the referee requests, listed in order, are as follows:

Paraphrased referee request 1)
  The model should fit the experimentally measured inelastic proton-proton
  cross section.

We should have explained this in the original manuscript more clearly.
We do indeed fit the experimentally measured inelastic proton-proton
cross section for every combination of proton substructure parameters.
This constraint is enforced numerically by Trento at run-time by tuning
the constituent opacity parameter to fit the experimental p-p cross section
at the chosen beam energy. We've added some dicussion following Eq. 3,
attached below, to clarify this procedure.

  We tune $\sigma_\mathrm{eff}$ in the present work to fit the experimental
  inelastic nucleon-nucleon cross section $\sigma_\text{NN}^\text{inel}=
  7.0$~fm$^2$ at $\sqrts=5.02$~TeV for comparison with our chosen datasets
  \cite{ALICE:2012xs}. The resulting \trento\ inelastic nucleon-nucleon
  cross section agrees with the experimental value to better than 2\%
  accuracy, as verified by one of the model's standard unit tests.

Paraphrased referee request 2)
  The authors should compute the model's predicted proton-proton
  inelasticity density and compare it to estimates extracted from
  experimental measurements of the proton-proton scattering amplitude.

We followed the referee's suggestion and computed the proton-proton
inelasticity density predicted by our model and Bayesian posterior. We
compare our prediction to estimates obtained by fitting parametrizations
to the experimentally measured proton-proton differential scattering
amplitude at 7 TeV. The result of this comparison, summarized by Fig. 10,
suggests that our protons are somewhat oversized. This observation was
already mentioned in the original manuscript, but we have expanded on it
to reflect the additional comparison to data. Our additions to the text
are attached below.

  Additional constraints on the proton size and shape are provided by the
  proton-proton inelasticity density $G_\mathrm{inel}(b) =
  d^2\sigma_\mathrm{inel}(b)/d^2b$, which measures the proton-proton
  inelastic collision probability as a function of its impact parameter.
  We compare in Fig~\ref{fig:inelasticity_profile} the normalized
  proton-proton inelasticity density $G_\mathrm{inel}(b) /
  G_\mathrm{inel}(0)$ at $\sqrts=5.02$~TeV predicted by \trento\ using the
  present study's posterior median parameters with a calculation that
  extracted the proton-proton inelasticity density using a parametrization
  fit to the proton-proton differential scattering amplitude at $\sqrts=7$~TeV
  \cite{Albacete:2016pmp}. Our Bayesian median estimate (orange line)
  prefers a larger width for the proton-proton normalized inelasticity
  density compared to that of reference \cite{Albacete:2016pmp}, and this
  trend is \emph{opposite} what one would expect based on the difference
  in beam energy alone. This suggests that our posterior estimate for the
  proton radius is somewhat oversized. Nevertheless, it is fascinating that
  the present Bayesian estimate is as close as it is, given that the model
  is fit to quantities which are not typically used to extract the
  proton-proton inelasticity density.

We also revised our discussion of the proton width parameter in the Summary
and Conclusions section.

  The present Bayesian analysis prefers larger nucleons, w âˆ¼ 1 fm, in
  agreement with a similar Bayesian analysis calibrated to Pb-Pb data at
  $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.76$ and 5.02 TeV using a hybrid model without nucleon
  substructure [49]. We note that our result is in significant tension with
  an estimate for the effective nucleon width based on the gluon distribution
  extracted from HERA data [93]. Our model calculations also predict a broader
  proton-proton inelasticity density at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV than
  supported by the data [37]. This suggests that our reconstructed
  protons are somewhat oversized.

We thank the referee for the constructive criticisms which have greatly
improved the manuscript.
